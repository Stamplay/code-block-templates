    Since you're executing Node.js code you are able to do HTTP[S] requests from your CodeBlock in a really easy way.
    To make your life easier you can use the request module and many others.

    { "request":"2.85.0"}
code: |
    const request = require('request');
    module.exports = function (cb) {
      return request('http://google.com', function (err, response, body) {
        return cb(err, response.statusCode);
      });
    };
