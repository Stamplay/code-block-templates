    As you can see the function we're defining takes a callback
    function that must be invoked when the code is completed.
    Since this code will run in a Node.js environment the callback
    will take as a first argument an error and as a second argument
    the result which can be a string, a number, or an object that will
    be stringified as JSON.
code: |
    module.exports = function (cb) {
      /**
      *
      * if you want to send a json instead
      *  return cb(null,{
      *    hello: 'world'
      *  });
      */
      return cb(null, 'Hello world!');
    };

  method: 'POST'
