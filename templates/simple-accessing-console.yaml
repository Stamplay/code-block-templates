    For debugging purposes can be useful have a look at the variable
    values by using console.log. You can see real time logs by enabling
    the console from the Editor.

    After each Code Block execution you can see the request and the
    response body in the Stamplay Editor from the Logs view.
code:
  es6: |
    module.exports = function (cb) {
      /**
       * You can see the console.log output in the Code Block log from the real time console
       */
      console.log('Hello world in console');
      return cb(null, 'Hello world, check the logs section in the Editor!');
    };
