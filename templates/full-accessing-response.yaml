    In order to have a full control of the CodeBlock we need to use a third, different function signature that takes three arguments context,req and res.
    In this example we'll send a json in the response but since now we've got control full control of it we'll need to set the correct Content-Type manually.
    This kind of control open to developers infinite use cases that process the request in different and unusual ways.
code: |
    module.exports = function(context, req, res){
     res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json'});
     res.end('{"hello": "world"}');
    }
body:
  parse: true
  merge: true
