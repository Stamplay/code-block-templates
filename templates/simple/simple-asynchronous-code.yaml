  Asynchronous code execution in Code Blocks.
note:
  title: instructions
  content: |
    Since you have a callback you can execute any kind of asynchronous code you like.
    Here you can see that we're just using the setTimeout function but you can connect to a database (but make sure to use secrets!), execute a query and then return the results of the query.
    Please note that a CodeBlock execution can last at maximum 60 seconds.
code:
  es6: |
    module.exports = function (cb) {
      return setTimeout(function () {
        return cb(null, 'Hi');
      }, 1000);
    };
sampleRequest: 
  method: 'POST'
  type: 'json'
  mode: 'body'
  data: |
    {}
settings:
  parse: true
  merge: true
