    Sometimes you just want to return an error, other time you just want to handle it in a nicer way.
    The callback function can be invoked with a string or an object that has the property `message` in it in order to make the CodeBlock return with an error.
code: |
    module.exports = function (cb) {
      return cb({
        message: 'Sending error in obj'
      });
    };
sampleRequest:
  method: 'POST'
  type: 'json'
  mode: 'body'
  data: |
    {}
body:
  parse: true
  merge: true
